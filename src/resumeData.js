    "aboutme":`Hi, my name is Kevin Hernandez and I am a web developer. I would say that web development
     has become something that I enjoy doing something about having a bug in 
     your code finding it and fixing it is very satisfying. Coding is very 
     fun but it's not the only thing I enjoy doing. I was introduced to cars
      at a very early age by my dad and The Fast and The Furious. My dad is 
      a mechanic so he is always talking about cars and you already know that
       he made me help him work on cars. Working on cars is a lot like coding
        you try things until you find the solution and if you try to implement 
        something new it might end up breaking everything! I also like playing 
        video games, genres ranging from RPGs, MOBAs,  FPS and many more.
         I have like looking for a better/ more efficient way of doing things.
          In a MOBA they are always changing the “meta” and you always have to
           adapt to that “meta” which includes looking for a better way to do 
           things to keep up with some of the better players. So yea that’s a 
           little insight into who Kevin Hernandez is.`,
